        We need to generate a report based on the user request. The report must be based on our existing data and cannot refer to 
        any other data that does not appear in our existing data.
        
        You need to generate a series of queries written in natural language that will be used to get the data for the report. 
        We will run these queries and then send you the query results to generate a report based on the data obtained. Please return 
        a JSON string in the following format:
            [ "query 1", "query 2", ... ]

        Here are some sample queries and you can create more queries as need. Make sure each query only ask for one class of entities.

            Find all drought zones intersecting counties the Muskingum River flows through.

            Find the watershed(s) the Muskingum River belongs to.
            Find the basins the Muskingum River is part of.

        Please note that the following query is wrong: "Find all buildings, power stations, and underground storage tanks in Ross County, Ohio.",
        because it asks to return three classes of entities: building, power stations and underground storage tanks.
