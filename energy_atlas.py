        [ Definition 1 ] 
        We have the following function to get coal mines from an ArcGIS Feature Service as a 
        GeoDataFrame:
            load_coal_mines(where_condition)
        
        The returned GeoDataFrame has the following columns:
            'geometry', 'OBJECTID', 'MSHA_ID', 'MINE_NAME', 'MINE_TYPE',
            'MINE_STATE', 'STATE', 'FIPS_COUNTY', 'MINE_COUNTY', 'PRODUCTION',
            'PHYSICAL_UNIT', 'REFUSE', 'Source', 'PERIOD', 'Longitude', 'Latitude'
            
        Use the column 'STATE' rather than the column 'MINE_STATE' to find coal mines in a state. 
        The values in the column 'STATE' are all in upper case like 'ALABAMA' or 'COLORADO' etc. 
        The column 'COUNTY' contains values like 'Walker' or 'Jefferson'. 
        
        To get all coal mines, call load_coal_mines with "1 = 1" as where_condition.

        [ Definition 2 ] 
        We have the following functions to get coal power plants/wind power plants/battery storage plants/
        geothermal power plants/hydro pumped storage power plants/natural gas power plants/nuclear power plants/
        petroleum power plants/solar power plants from an ArcGIS Feature Service as a GeoDataFrame:
            load_coal_power_plants(where_condition)
            load_wind_power_plants(where_condition)
            load_battery_storage_plants(where_condition)

            load_nuclear_power_plants(where_condition)
            load_petroleum_power_plants(where_condition)
            load_solar_power_plants(where_condition)
        
        The returned GeoDataFrame has the following columns:
            'geometry', 'OBJECTID', 'Plant_Code', 'Plant_Name', 'Utility_ID', 'Utility_Name', 'sector_name', 
            'Street_Address', 'City', 'County', 'State', 'Zip', 'PrimSource', 'source_desc', 'tech_desc', 
            'Install_MW', 'Total_MW', 'Bat_MW', 'Bio_MW', 'Coal_MW', 'Geo_MW', 'Hydro_MW', 'HydroPS_MW', 
            'NG_MW', 'Nuclear_MW', 'Crude_MW', 'Solar_MW', 'Wind_MW', 'Other_MW', 'Source', 'Period', 
            'Longitude', 'Latitude'
            
        The values in the column 'State' are case sensitive like 'Nebraska' or 'Montana' or 'Kentucky' etc. 
        The column 'County' contains values like 'Adams' or 'Yellowstone'. The column 'Total_MW' gives the 
        Total Megawatts of the plants.

        Note that use the case sensitive state names for the column 'State'.

        [ Definition 3 ]
        We have the following function to get renewable diesel fuel and other biofuel plants/biodiesel plants
        from an ArcGIS Feature Service as a GeoDataFrame:
            load_renewable_diesel_fuel_and_other_biofuel_plants(where_condition)
            load_biodiesel_plants(where_condition)

        The returned GeoDataFrame has the following columns:
            'geometry', 'OBJECTID', 'Company', 'Site', 'State', 'PADD', 'Cap_Mmgal',
           'Source', 'Period', 'Longitude', 'Latitude'
           
        The values in the column 'State' are case sensitive like 'Nebraska' or 'Montana' etc.
        
        To get all coal mines/coal power plants/wind power plants/renewable diesel fuel and 
        other biofuel plants and etc, call the correspondent function with "1 = 1" as where_condition.

        [ Available Data ]
        The following are the variables with the data:
            {variables}
                        
        [ Question ]
        The following is the question from the user:
            {question}

        Please return only the complete Python code in the following format to implement the user's request without preamble or 
        explanation. 
            # other code which do not change spatial_datasets
            gdf = ......
            gdf.title = ......
        Don't include any print statement. Don't add ``` around the code. Make a title and save the title in gdf.title.  

        [ Example 1]
        Find all coal mines along Ohio River. 

        Find out if one of the available variables is a geodataframe containing Ohio River.

        If none of the available variables are geodataframes containing Ohio River, then return the following code:
            raise Exception("The data for Ohio River is missing. Please load Ohio River first.")
        
        If you found a variable which is a geodataframe containing Ohio River, then return the valid Python code in the 
        following format:
            gdf1 = <replace by the variable of the geodataframe for Ohio River if you found one>
            gdf2 = load_coal_mines("1 = 1")
            # Keep the following line exactly as it is
            distance_threshold = 0.2
            gdf2['distance_to_river'] = gdf2.geometry.apply(lambda x: gdf1.distance(x).min())
            gdf = gdf2[gdf2['distance_to_river'] <= distance_threshold]
            gdf = gdf.drop(columns=['distance_to_river'])
            gdf.title = "All Coal Mines within 10 Miles away from Ohio River"
        
        [ Example 2 ]
        Find all coal power plants along Ohio River.

        Use the same way as Example 1 to implement it. Just replace load_coal_mines by load_coal_power_plants
        and change the title. If none of the available variables are geodataframes containing Ohio River, then return the
        code raising the execption.

        [ Example 3 ]
        If the request is for an attribute of a particular plant, first obtain the plant as gdf, and then store the answer 
        to the user in gdf.answer. For example, find the capacity of the coal power plant Rockport.
            gdf = load_coal_power_plants("Plant_Name = 'Rockport'")
            gdf.title = "The Coal Power Plant Rockport"
            gdf.answer = f"The capacity of the coal power plant Rockport is {{gdf.iloc[0]['Total_MW']}} megawatt."

        [ Note 1 ]
        Use pandas.concat to concatenate two geodataframe gdf1 and gdf2:
            gdf = pd.concat([gdf1, gdf2], ignore_index=True)
            gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(gdf, geometry='geometry')

        [ Example 4 ]
        Find all solar power plants in all counties the Scioto River flows through.

        Find out if one of the available variables is a geodataframe containing all counties the Scioto River flows through.

        If none of the available variables are geodataframes containing all counties the Scioto River flows through, 
        then return the following code:
            raise Exception("The data for all counties the Scioto River flows through is missing. Please it first.")
        
        If you found a variable which is a geodataframe containing all counties the Scioto River flows through, then return 
        the valid Python code in the following format:
            gdf1 = <replace by the variable of the geodataframe for all counties the Scioto River flows through if you found one>
            gdf2 = load_solar_power_plants("1 = 1")
            gdf = gpd.sjoin(gdf2, gdf1, how="inner", predicate="intersects")
            gdf = gdf[gdf2.columns]
            gdf.title = "All solar power plants in all counties the Scioto River flows through"
